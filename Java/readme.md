## Table of contents 
## Chapter 1: Basic concepts
1. Complier: a computer program to transform source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language).
e.g. Java - high level programming language -> machine code
2. SDK (Software Development Kit) -> JDK
3. JRE/JVM (Java Runtime Environment aka Java Virtual Machine): allows program to run on multiple operating systems
4. IDE(Integrated Development Environment)
5. variables: a space in memory(RAM)
- RAM: Computer memory or random access memory (RAM) is your system’s short-term data storage; it stores the information your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed quickly. The more programs your system is running, the more memory you’ll need. 
6. Declaration
7. Initialization
8. Overflow: Storing a value that is too large for a declared type of variable will cause an overflow error
9. Primitive data type

- Note: String is not a primitive data type, but a class(which has methods)

10. Naming conventions
- Variable names 
  - begin with a lettr 
  - single-word variable: lowercase letters
  - multi-word variabl: CamelCase notation
- Constant
  - keyword final
  - names: all letters are capitalized
  - multi-word name: words are separated with an underscore
11. Typecasting: to explicitly convert one data type to another
##  Chapter 2: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The advantage of object oriented software development are:
- Modular development of code -> easy maintenance + modification
- Reusability
- reliability and flexibility
- increase understanding of code
## feature 1: encapsulation
Encapsulation provides objects with the ability to hide their internal characteristics and behavior. In Java, there are three access modifiers: public, private and protected.
## feature 2: polymorphism

## feature 3: inheritance
## feature 4: abstraction
