## OOD basics
### Design process
1. gather requirements & discover classes
- look for the nouns and verbs in the requirements specification
  - nouns: classes
  - verbs: methods
- Some of the classes that may already exist(standard library/developed previously) : use inheritance to extend 
2. use CRC card method to find 
- C: classes
- R: responsibilities
- C: collaborators
3. use UML diagrams to record class relationships
4. use javadoc to document method behavior
5. implement the program
### Relationships between classes
1. dependency
2. aggregation
3. inheritance
