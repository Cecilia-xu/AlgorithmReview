# Intuition
Binary search is a textbook algorithm based on the idea to compare the target value to the middle element of the array.
If the target value is equal to the middle element - we're done.
If the target value is smaller - continue to search on the left.
If the target value is larger - continue to search on the right.
# How to code correctly
Things we can learn from binary search:
1. figure out the definination of each variable (especially the range)
2. make sure the definination of each variable will never change (especially in loops) 
3. test your code by any small dataset
4. comprehend the condition of loop — core：narrow down the search(逼近的思想)
