# How to code correctly
Things we can learn from binary search:
1. figure out the definination of each variable (especially the range)
2. make sure the definination of each variable will never change (especially in loops) 
3. test your code by any small dataset
4. comprehend the condition of loop — core：narrow down the search(逼近的思想)
